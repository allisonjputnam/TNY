    <p class="myromance">My romance with Hollywood memoirs began in my early twenties, 
      when I was new to New York and would spend most Sunday afternoons wandering 
      the aisles of the Strand bookstore. The “Film and Television” section was a 
      kaleidoscope of out-of-print treasures, and I found that their contents were 
      even more outrageous and entertaining than the hammy portraits on their covers. </p>
      
      <p class="myromance">The Hollywood memoir is a perfect genre for summertime, when your mind 
      is as gooey and malleable as a slice of American cheese, because it demands that you be 
      willing to suspend your disbelief and indulge in dazzling lies. After all, that is what 
      many Hollywood memoirs are—at least, it is what they were, before the modern era of public 
      accountability and stroke-of-the-keyboard fact-checking. The sooner you accept that star 
      stories are full of embellishments and omissions, invented quotes and one-sided recollections 
      dictacted to patient ghostwriters, the sooner you’ll come to appreciate them as the grand 
      and eccentric performances that they are. </p>

    <p class="myromance">Often, though, these books reveal as much as they hide. 
      Autobiography was for a long time the best outlet stars had to talk openly 
      about misogyny, racism, ageism, abuse, and other hideous aspects of life in
       Hollywood that the industry would rather ignore. The list compiled here is 
       by no means exhaustive; it’s not a best-of but a starter pack of sorts. 
       (Confession: I’ve left out men altogether, though many, including David Niven 
       and Sammy Davis, Jr., have produced wonderful show-biz memoirs.) Some of the 
       books here feel dated and, at times, maddening; at least one is completely bonkers. 
       But all are dynamic artifacts that chart how the movie business has evolved over
        time and how far it still has to go.  </p>
        
    <p class="myromance">I should note that several of the books are out of print and 
      require some hunting to find—but that’s half the fun. Go to a used bookstore and 
      check the biography and memoir shelves. These exact Hollywood memoirs may not be 
      there, but dozens of others will be. Lug a few home. And then, on a sweltering day,
       pick one up and give yourself over.</p>
